 Ride Booking Analytics ‚Äì July Monthly Performance Review
üß© Business Problem:
The ride-sharing platform is experiencing a high cancellation rate (~38%) despite generating 57M in revenue. The business seeks to understand:

Why are cancellations so high?

Which vehicle types, days, and locations perform best?

What actions can be taken to improve booking success and customer satisfaction?

 Tools Used:
Power BI: For interactive data visualization

SQL: For querying booking, vehicle, and customer datasets

Excel (optional): For pre-processing and validation

Dashboard Analysis:
Key KPIs:
Total Bookings: 103K

Completed Rides: 64K

Cancelled Rides: 39K

Cancellation Rate: 37.91% (critical issue)

Total Revenue: 57M

Avg. Booking Value: ‚Çπ548.75

Avg. Ride Distance: 14.19 km

 Deep Dive Analysis:
1. Daily Booking Trend
Bookings remained consistent (~3K daily).

Cancellation patterns are stable but persistent each day.

Peak revenue days are around July 1st and July 29th (~1.9M).

 2. Vehicle Type Performance
All vehicle types are equally utilized (‚âà14K bookings each), suggesting balanced demand.

Prime Sedan has the highest avg. booking value (‚Çπ557.81) and ride distance (15.76 km).

Mini has the lowest avg. ride distance (6.24 km), but similar booking value, suggesting inefficiency.

 3. Location-Wise Booking
Top pickup zones: Banashankari, Yeshwanthpur, RT Nagar.

These top 10 locations alone account for nearly 20% of bookings.

 4. Cancellation Insights
Highest cancellations by Driver: 18.4K (~47%)

Driver Not Found: 10.1K (~25.9%) ‚Üí Opportunity for fleet/logistics optimization.

Cancellations by Customers: 10.4K (~27%) ‚Üí Could indicate poor driver behavior, wait time, or pricing.

 5. Booking Value by Status
Success bookings contribute overwhelmingly to total revenue (~36M+).

Cancelled bookings contribute little or zero revenue, adding to opportunity cost.

 Business Insights:
Driver-side issues (no-shows or cancellations) are more frequent than customer-side, suggesting operational inefficiencies.

Revenue opportunity lost from 39K cancellations is significant (~37% potential increase in revenue).

Prime Sedan offers the highest revenue per km; worth expanding fleet in high-demand zones.

Locations like Indiranagar and Banashankari show consistently high booking counts ‚Üí Target for customer loyalty or surge pricing.

 Recommendations:
Reduce Cancellations:

Implement driver penalty system for frequent cancellations.

Use machine learning to predict ‚Äúhigh cancellation risk‚Äù rides (based on time, location, vehicle).

Improve driver availability in peak hours/locations.

Fleet Optimization:

Increase Prime Sedan and eBike vehicles in high-demand areas to maximize revenue per km.

Reduce Mini fleet or assign to short-distance locations to avoid underutilization.

Customer Experience:

Offer incentives or coupons for repeat users in high-cancel zones.

Introduce real-time driver tracking and cancellation feedback.

Operational Improvement:

Set driver allocation KPIs: Driver response time, success ratio, cancellation score.

Optimize shift scheduling for drivers in high booking areas.
